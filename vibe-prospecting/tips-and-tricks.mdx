### 1. Layer Your Search

Start broad, then refine:

```
Step 1: "Find SaaS companies with 100-500 employees"
Step 2: "From those results, show me only ones using Salesforce"
Step 3: "Now find CTOs at those companies"
```

---

### 2. Combine Signals

Stack multiple indicators for higher quality:

```
Find VPs of Sales at companies that:
- Raised funding in the last 90 days
- Are hiring in sales department
- Use Salesforce and Outreach
- Have 50-200 employees
```

### 3. Use Exclusions Strategically

Create segments:

```
Query 1: "Find fintech prospects" (exports 500, all added to exclusion list)
Query 2: "Find fintech prospects excluding previously consumed" (returns 500 NEW prospects)
```

### 4. Leverage Reference Tables

Build on previous work:

```
Step 1: Find target companies
Step 2: Enrich with firmographics
Step 3: Use those companies to find multiple personas (CTO, VP Eng, Head of Product)
```

### 5. Validate Before Scaling

Test with small samples:

```
"Find 50 prospects matching [criteria]"
Review data quality
If good: "Find 1000 prospects matching [criteria]"
```
