## Using The Hub

### Accessing The Hub

The Hub is your central workspace for managing all prospecting data.

---

### Managing Exported Datasets

**View Your Datasets**

All exported data appears in the Hub with:

- Dataset name (auto-generated based on search)
- Entity count
- Export date
- Credit cost
- Status (ready, processing, error)

**Re-Import Previous Searches**

```
Load my dataset from last week about SaaS CTOs
```

The AI will:

1. Search your Hub for matching datasets
2. Show available options if multiple matches
3. Load the data into your current session
4. Allow you to enrich, filter, or export again

---

### Excluding Entities

**Automatic Exclusion**

Every export automatically adds entities to your exclusion list, preventing duplicates in future searches.

**Manual Exclusion**

```
Exclude all prospects from my "Q4 2024 Outreach" dataset
```

**Using Exclusion Lists**

```
Find new VPs of Sales at fintech companies, but exclude anyone I've already contacted
```

AI automatically applies your default exclusion list.

### Uploading CSV Files

**Use Cases for CSV Upload:**

1. **Enrich your existing data**: Upload company names/domains to get firmographics, tech stack, contacts
2. **Find contacts at your accounts**: Upload customer list to find decision-makers
3. **Clean and standardize data**: Upload messy data to get standardized Explorium IDs and enriched fields

**How to Upload**

### Working with Referenced Data

**Refining Previous Searches**

```
From my last search of SaaS companies, find only those in California
```

AI uses `businesses_reference_table` to filter previous results without re-fetching.

**Cross-Referencing Datasets**

```
Find prospects at companies from my "Series B SaaS" dataset who joined in the last 6 months
```

Combines company data from one search with prospect filtering in another.
