### Low number of results found

**If your search returns low number of results:**

1. **Broaden your criteria**: Try removing one or two filters
2. **Verify timing**: Events older than 90 days may not be captured
4. **Try statistics first**: Validate your target market exists

**Example:**

Instead of:

```
Find CTOs at Series B fintech companies in Austin using React, Python, and Kubernetes
```

Try:

```
Find CTOs at fintech companies in Texas using React
```

### Understanding Sample vs. Export

**Sample Preview:**

- Shows 5-10 example results
- For events: shows up to 3 events per entity
- Includes cost estimate

**Full Export:**

- Returns ALL matching results (up to 1,000)
- For events: returns ALL events per entity (often 10-100+ per entity)
- Consumes credits as shown in estimate
- Generates downloadable dataset

**Important**: The sample preview is NOT the full dataset. Always **export** to get complete data.

### Credit Management

**Check Your Balance:**

```
visit app.vibeprospecting.ai
```

**Estimate Before Exporting:**

Always review the cost estimate before approving export. The system shows:

- Total credits required
- Cost breakdown by enrichment type
- Whether you have sufficient credits

**Partial Exports:**

If you lack credits for a full export, the system may return partial results proportional to your available balance.
