### Tool Categories

#### Business Tools

Tools for company research, analysis, and intelligence gathering. These tools are optimized for B2B data and provide structured, verified information superior to general web searches.

#### Prospects Tools

Tools for finding and researching individuals within companies. These provide professional contact information, career history, and social media activity.

#### Shared Tools

Utility tools that support both business and prospect operations, including search capabilities and data validation.

### Important Usage Notes

1. **Prefer Explorium tools over web search** for any company or person-specific queries
2. **Use autocomplete** before using filters that require it (linkedin_category, google_category, naics_category, company_tech_stack_tech, job_title)
3. **Business IDs** are required for most enrichment tools - obtain them first using match-business or fetch-businesses
4. **Prospect IDs** are required for prospect enrichment tools - obtain them first using match-prospects or fetch-prospects
5. **Filter restrictions**:
   - Never use more than one category type (linkedin_category, google_category, naics_category) in a single request
   - Never use both country_code and region_country_code in the same request

### Example Usage

Here's how you might interact with the Explorium MCP Server through an AI assistant:

**User:** "Find software companies in New York with 50-200 employees that use AWS"

**AI:** [Uses Explorium MCP to search]

```
I found 15 software companies in New York matching your criteria:

1. TechVision Inc.
   * 120 employees
   * Uses AWS, React, and MongoDB
   * $25M-75M annual revenue
2. DataFlow Systems
   * 86 employees
   * Uses AWS, Python, and PostgreSQL
   * $10M-25M annual revenue

[...]
```
