**Business Intelligence**

- Company search and matching
- Firmographic enrichment
- Technology stack analysis
- Financial metrics (public companies)
- Competitive landscape insights

**Contact Discovery**

- Employee search by role/department
- Contact information enrichment
- Professional profile data
- Work history and experience
- Social media activity

**Market Intelligence**

- Industry trends and statistics
- Company events and news
- Website changes monitoring
- Workforce trend analysis
- Funding and acquisition data

## Best Practices for Integrating AgentSource MCP

Here are some recommendations for optimal integration of Explorium's AgentSource MCP server into your AI agent application. Following these practices will help you achieve reliable, high-quality results similar to our MCP Playground.

### System Prompt Guidelines

**Core Principles**

Effective MCP performance is highly dependent on your system prompt. You may need to iterate and refine your prompt to achieve optimal results for your specific use case.

**Reference System Prompt**

Below is the system prompt used in Explorium's MCP Playground. This can serve as a baseline for your implementation:

```
The assistant is **AgentSource**, created by Explorium.   
Current date: {currentDateTime} 
You are an **interactive Explorium API agent**.   
Your job: demonstrate Explorium's data power through real-time research. 

## 1. Workflow 
1. **Search session** – for lists of companies.   
   * Call `get_search_filters` first and use only the returned filters.   
2. **Research session** – for a specific company.   
   * Call `create_company_research_session`. 

At each step:   
- State how many matches were found.   
- Wait for further user input.   
- Suggest useful enrichments when relevant. 

## 2. Response style 
* Mention that you are using the Explorium API (not tool names or "sessions"). 
  * e.g. "I'm searching Explorium's database…" 
* **Do not mention internal function names (`get_search_filters`, etc.).** 
* Write in **Markdown**.   
  * Use tables for multi-row output, for example:
| Company | Location | Revenue | 
|---------|----------|---------| 
| …       | …        | …       |

* After a table, keep extra text minimal.   
* On tool error or no data: reply only "An error occurred." 

## 3. Search-filter rules 
* Autocomplete queries must include **all** user concepts.   
* If multiple industries are mentioned, include them all. 

## 4. Internet usage 
Only query the public web if the Explorium API lacks the answer; 
tell the user when you do.
```

**Customization Tips**

When adapting this system prompt for your application:

- **Replace the date placeholder**: Update `{currentDateTime}` with your actual date/time variable or remove if not needed
- **Adjust the identity**: Modify "The assistant is **AgentSource**" to match your agent's branding
- **Tailor the workflow**: Add or modify workflow steps based on your specific use case
- **Customize response style**: Adapt formatting and verbosity requirements to match your application's UX
- **Add domain-specific instructions**: Include any industry or use-case specific guidance relevant to your users

### Model Selection

**Recommended Models**

We **highly recommend** using **Claude Sonnet** models for optimal performance:

- Claude 4.5 Sonnet (primary recommendation)
- Claude 4.0 Sonnet (alternative)

**Alternative Models**

If you need to use alternative models, the following have been tested:

- OpenAI GPT-5
- OpenAI GPT-4.1

Note: Results may vary with non-Claude models. We recommend thorough testing if using alternatives.

### Model Parameters

**Temperature Settings**

**Critical**: Use a **low temperature** setting to ensure reliable MCP tool usage.

- **Recommended range**: 0.0 - 0.1
- **Explorium uses**: 0.05
- **Why this matters**: Higher temperature values may cause the agent to query MCP tools incorrectly or inconsistently

### Other Parameters

Consider these additional parameter recommendations:

- **Max tokens**: Set appropriately for your use case - we recommend not limiting the number of tokens.
- **Top-p**: If used, keep at 0.9 or lower for consistent behavior

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Tool Calling Instructions

1. **Be explicit about workflow**: Clearly define when and how each MCP tool should be used
2. **Handle errors gracefully**: Provide clear instructions on error handling and fallback behavior

### Response Formatting

1. **Specify output format**: Be explicit about Markdown formatting, table usage, and response structure
2. **User experience**: Include guidelines on when to wait for user input vs. proceeding automatically

### Testing and Iteration

**Validation Steps**

1. **Test common queries**: Validate your integration with typical user queries in your domain
2. **Edge case testing**: Test with complex, multi-filter queries
3. **Error scenarios**: Verify behavior when API calls fail or return no results
4. **Consistency checks**: Run the same query multiple times to ensure consistent behavior

**Performance Optimization**

1. **Monitor tool calling patterns**: Ensure the agent is calling tools in the optimal sequence
2. **Review response quality**: Check that responses are well-formatted and user-friendly
3. **Iterate on the system prompt**: Refine instructions based on observed agent behavior
4. **A/B test variations**: Try different prompt formulations to find what works best for your use case

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Using high temperature settings (\> 0.1)
- ❌ Exposing internal function names in user-facing responses
- ❌ Insufficient error handling instructions
- ❌ Vague or ambiguous workflow instructions
