## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before implementing AgentSource MCP, ensure you have:

1. **AgentSource API Key** - [Get your API key](/reference/setup/getting_your_api_key)
2. **Development Environment** - Python 3.8+ recommended
3. **Basic Understanding** - Familiarity with REST APIs and async programming

### Core Concepts

#### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables AI models and applications to discover and use tools dynamically. With AgentSource MCP, you get:

- **Type Safety** - Structured inputs and outputs
- **Streaming Support** - Real-time data updates via SSE

#### Available Tool Categories

**Business Intelligence**

- Company search and matching
- Firmographic enrichment
- Technology stack analysis
- Financial metrics (public companies)
- Competitive landscape insights

**Contact Discovery**

- Employee search by role/department
- Contact information enrichment
- Professional profile data
- Work history and experience
- Social media activity

**Market Intelligence**

- Industry trends and statistics
- Company events and news
- Website changes monitoring
- Workforce trend analysis
- Funding and acquisition data
