---

## Getting Started

### Basic Query Structure

Simply tell the AI what you're looking for:

```
Find VP of Sales at Series B SaaS companies in California with 100-500 employees
```

The AI will:

1. Parse your requirements
2. Apply appropriate filters
3. Show you a sample preview with estimated cost
4. Wait for your confirmation before exporting

### Your First Search

**Example 1: Finding Decision Makers**

```
Get me CTOs at fintech companies in New York that raised funding in the last 90 days
```

**What happens:**

- AI identifies entity type: prospects
- Filters: job_title (CTO), linkedin_category (fintech), location (New York), events (funding)
- Returns sample with estimated export cost
- Waits for your approval to export

**Example 2: Finding Companies**

```
Show me B2B SaaS companies with 50-200 employees using Salesforce in their tech stack
```

**What happens:**

- AI identifies entity type: businesses
- Filters: industry (SaaS), size (50-200), technology (Salesforce)
- Returns company details in sample preview
- Shows cost estimate for full export

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Sales Prospecting

**Scenario**: Find decision-makers at high-growth companies

```
Find VPs of Engineering at companies that increased their engineering department by 20%+ in the last 60 days
```

**Why it works**: Combines role targeting with hiring signals to identify companies actively scaling their teams.

---

### 2. Market Research

**Scenario**: Analyze market segments

```
Get me statistics on healthcare software companies in the US with 100-1000 employees, 
broken down by revenue range
```

**Why it works**: Uses the statistics endpoint to provide market insights without consuming credits on individual records.

---

### 3. Event-Driven Outreach

**Scenario**: Reach companies during key moments

```
Find marketing directors at companies that just opened new offices in the last 30 days
```

**Why it works**: Targets prospects during organizational changes when they're more likely to need new solutions.

---

### 4. Account Expansion

**Scenario**: Find new contacts at existing customers

```
I have a list of 50 companies. Find all C-level executives in the sales and marketing 
departments at these companies.
```

**Why it works**: Upload your customer list to the Hub, then use it as a reference to find additional decision-makers.

---

### 5. Competitive Intelligence

**Scenario**: Monitor competitor customers

```
Find companies using [Competitor Product] with 500+ employees in the enterprise software space
```

**Why it works**: Identifies prospects using competitor technology who might be open to switching.

---

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Queries

**Be Specific About What You Need**

✅ **Good**: "Find CTOs at Series B fintech companies in San Francisco with 50-200 employees"

❌ **Avoid**: "Find some tech people"

**Combine Multiple Criteria**

✅ **Good**: "Sales directors at SaaS companies that raised funding in the last 90 days and use Salesforce"

❌ **Avoid**: Making separate searches that could be combined

**Use Natural Language**

✅ **Good**: "Companies that recently expanded their engineering teams"

❌ **Avoid**: Trying to write filter syntax manually

---

### Understanding Entity Types

Vibe Prospecting works with two entity types:

**Choose "Prospects" when you need:**

- Individual people/contacts
- Email addresses or phone numbers
- Specific job titles or roles
- Decision-makers at companies

**Choose "Businesses" when you need:**

- Company information only
- Firmographics or technographics
- Market research data
- Lists of organizations

**The AI automatically determines entity type**, but mentioning "people," "contacts," or "executives" will ensure prospect results.

---

### Optimizing Credit Usage

**1. Start with statistics**

Before running expensive prospect searches:

```
What's the market size of cybersecurity companies with 100-500 employees in the US?
```

This helps validate your target market without using credits.

**2. Review samples before exporting**

Always check the sample preview to ensure:

- Results match your expectations
- Data quality meets your needs
- Cost is acceptable for your budget

**3. Use exclusion lists**

Prevent duplicate spending:

```
Find new prospects, but exclude entities I've already exported
```

**4. Be precise with enrichments**

Only request enrichments you'll actually use:

```
Enrich with contacts only
```

vs.

```
Enrich with everything available
```

---

### Handling Large Datasets

**For queries returning 1,000+ results:**

The system caps at 1,000 results per query. To get more:

```
First query: "Find SaaS companies in California with 100-500 employees"
Second query: "Find SaaS companies in New York with 100-500 employees"
```

Split by geography, industry subcategory, or company size.

---

## Working with Enrichments

### When to Enrich

Enrichments add detailed information but consume additional credits. Request them when:

1. **You need contact information**: Always use `enrich-prospects-contacts` for emails/phones
2. **You need company details**: Use `enrich-business-firmographics` for basic company info
3. **You need technology insights**: Use `enrich-business-technographics` for full tech stack
4. **You need funding data**: Use `enrich-business-funding-and-acquisitions` for investment history

### Enrichment Examples

**Getting Email Addresses**

```
Find marketing managers at fintech companies, and get their email addresses
```

AI automatically applies: `enrich-prospects-contacts`

**Getting Company Technology Stack**

```
Show me which technologies are used by top e-commerce companies
```

AI automatically applies: `enrich-business-technographics`

**Multiple Enrichments**

```
Find CTOs at recently funded companies and get their emails, plus company funding details
```

AI applies both: `enrich-prospects-contacts` and `enrich-business-funding-and-acquisitions`

---

## Understanding Costs

### Credit System

Vibe Prospecting uses Explorium credits:

- **Base fetch**: ~1 credit per entity
- **Enrichments**: Additional credits per enrichment type per entity
- **Events**: Additional credits when fetching detailed event information

### Cost Estimation

Before any export, you'll see:

```
Export Cost: 450 credits

Sample Preview (5 of 150):
[Table with sample data and cost_in_credits column]

Ready to Export? Get all 150 prospects with full details
👉 Say "export" to download the complete dataset as CSV 👈
```

**Never auto-exports** - you always approve costs first.

---

## Using The Hub

### Accessing The Hub

[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Hub dashboard showing datasets, credit usage, and upload button]

The Hub is your central workspace for managing all prospecting data.

---

### Managing Exported Datasets

**View Your Datasets**

All exported data appears in the Hub with:

- Dataset name (auto-generated based on search)
- Entity count
- Export date
- Credit cost
- Status (ready, processing, error)

**Re-Import Previous Searches**

```
Load my dataset from last week about SaaS CTOs
```

The AI will:

1. Search your Hub for matching datasets
2. Show available options if multiple matches
3. Load the data into your current session
4. Allow you to enrich, filter, or export again

---

### Excluding Entities

**Automatic Exclusion**

Every export automatically adds entities to your exclusion list, preventing duplicates in future searches.

**Manual Exclusion**

```
Exclude all prospects from my "Q4 2024 Outreach" dataset
```

**Using Exclusion Lists**

```
Find new VPs of Sales at fintech companies, but exclude anyone I've already contacted
```

AI automatically applies your default exclusion list.

---

### Uploading CSV Files

**Use Cases for CSV Upload:**

1. **Enrich your existing data**: Upload company names/domains to get firmographics, tech stack, contacts
2. **Find contacts at your accounts**: Upload customer list to find decision-makers
3. **Clean and standardize data**: Upload messy data to get standardized Explorium IDs and enriched fields

**How to Upload**

[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: CSV upload interface with drag-and-drop area]

**Step 1: Prepare Your CSV**

Your CSV should contain:

For businesses:

```
company_name,domain
Explorium,explorium.ai
Anthropic,anthropic.com
```

For prospects:

```
full_name,company_name,email
John Smith,Acme Corp,john@acme.com
Jane Doe,Acme Corp,jane@acme.com
```

**Step 2: Upload to Hub**

1. Click "Upload CSV" in the Hub
2. Drag and drop your file or click to browse
3. Map your CSV columns to Explorium fields
4. Review mapping and confirm upload

**Step 3: Process Your Data**

Once uploaded, tell the AI what you want:

```
Find all C-level executives at the companies in my uploaded list
```

Or:

```
Enrich my uploaded companies with technographics and funding data
```

**Step 4: Export Results**

Review the sample, approve costs, and export as usual.

---

### Working with Referenced Data

**Refining Previous Searches**

```
From my last search of SaaS companies, find only those in California
```

AI uses `businesses_reference_table` to filter previous results without re-fetching.

**Cross-Referencing Datasets**

```
Find prospects at companies from my "Series B SaaS" dataset who joined in the last 6 months
```

Combines company data from one search with prospect filtering in another.

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found

**If your search returns zero results:**

1. **Broaden your criteria**: Try removing one or two filters
2. **Check geography**: Ensure location codes are correct (use "US" not "USA")
3. **Verify timing**: Events older than 90 days may not be captured
4. **Try statistics first**: Validate your target market exists

**Example:**

Instead of:

```
Find CTOs at Series B fintech companies in Austin using React, Python, and Kubernetes
```

Try:

```
Find CTOs at fintech companies in Texas using React
```

---

### Understanding Sample vs. Export

**Sample Preview:**

- Shows 5-10 example results
- For events: shows up to 3 events per entity
- Includes cost estimate
- Does NOT consume credits

**Full Export:**

- Returns ALL matching results (up to 1,000)
- For events: returns ALL events per entity (often 10-100+ per entity)
- Consumes credits as shown in estimate
- Generates downloadable CSV

**Important**: The sample preview is NOT the full dataset. Always export to get complete data.

---

### Dataset Not Ready

If you see "dataset is processing":

1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** - Large datasets take time
2. **Check status** - "Ready" means you can export
3. **Try again** - Processing usually completes quickly

---

### Credit Management

**Check Your Balance:**

```
How many credits do I have?
```

**Estimate Before Exporting:**

Always review the cost estimate before approving export. The system shows:

- Total credits required
- Cost breakdown by enrichment type
- Whether you have sufficient credits

**Partial Exports:**

If you lack credits for a full export, the system may return partial results proportional to your available balance.

---

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Layer Your Search

Start broad, then refine:

```
Step 1: "Find SaaS companies with 100-500 employees"
Step 2: "From those results, show me only ones using Salesforce"
Step 3: "Now find CTOs at those companies"
```

---

### 2. Combine Signals

Stack multiple indicators for higher quality:

```
Find VPs of Sales at companies that:
- Raised funding in the last 90 days
- Are hiring in sales department
- Use Salesforce and Outreach
- Have 50-200 employees
```

---

### 3. Use Exclusions Strategically

Create segments:

```
Query 1: "Find fintech prospects" (exports 500, all excluded)
Query 2: "Find fintech prospects" (returns 500 NEW prospects)
```

---

### 4. Leverage Reference Tables

Build on previous work:

```
Step 1: Find target companies
Step 2: Enrich with firmographics
Step 3: Use those companies to find multiple personas (CTO, VP Eng, Head of Product)
```

---

### 5. Validate Before Scaling

Test with small samples:

```
"Find 50 prospects matching [criteria]"
Review data quality
If good: "Find 1000 prospects matching [criteria]"
```
