## Overview

This n8n workflow monitors your HubSpot instance for newly created contacts and automatically enriches them with additional contact information. When a contact is created, the workflow:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Detects the new contact via HubSpot webhook trigger
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Retrieves recent contact details from HubSpot
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Matches the contact against Explorium's database using name, company, and email
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enriches the contact with professional emails and phone numbers
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Updates the HubSpot contact record with discovered information
    </Step>
</Steps>

This automation ensures your sales and marketing teams have complete contact information, improving outreach success rates and data quality.



## Key Features

- **Real-time Webhook Trigger**: Instantly processes new contacts as they're created
- **Intelligent Matching**: Uses multiple data points (name, company, email) for accurate matching
- **Comprehensive Enrichment**: Adds both professional and work emails, plus phone numbers
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles multiple contacts to optimize API usage
- **Smart Data Mapping**: Intelligently maps multiple emails and phone numbers

```

### Node Descriptions

1. **HubSpot Trigger**: Webhook that fires when new contacts are created
2. **HubSpot Recently Created**: Fetches details of recently created contacts
3. **Loop Over Items**: Processes contacts in batches of 6
4. **Explorium Match Prospects**: Finds matching person in Explorium database
5. **Filter**: Validates successful matches
6. **Extract Prospect IDs**: Collects matched prospect identifiers
7. **Enrich Contacts Information**: Fetches emails and phone numbers
8. **Enrich Profiles**: Gets additional profile data (optional)
9. **Merge**: Combines all enrichment results
10. **Split Out**: Separates individual enriched records
11. **Update HubSpot**: Updates contact with new information



### Data Mapping Logic

The workflow maps Explorium data to HubSpot properties:

| Explorium Data | HubSpot Property | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `professions_email` | `email` | Primary professional email |
| `emails[].address` | `work_email` | All email addresses joined |
| `phone_numbers[].phone_number` | `phone` | All phones joined with commas |
| `mobile_phone` | `phone` (fallback) | Used if no other phones found |



### Data Processing

The workflow handles complex data scenarios:

- **Multiple emails**: Joins all discovered emails with commas
- **Phone numbers**: Combines all phone numbers into a single field
- **Missing data**: Uses "null" as placeholder for empty fields
- **Name parsing**: Cleans sample data and special characters



## Usage & Operation

### Automatic Processing

Once activated:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Every new contact triggers the webhook immediately
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Contact is enriched within seconds
    </Step>
    <Step>
    HubSpot record is updated automatically
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Process repeats for each new contact
    </Step>
</Steps>


### Manual Testing

To test the workflow:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Use the pinned test data in the HubSpot Trigger node, or
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Create a test contact in HubSpot
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Monitor the execution in n8n
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Verify the contact was updated in HubSpot
    </Step>
</Steps>


### Monitoring Performance

Track workflow health:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Go to **Executions** in n8n
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Filter by this workflow
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Monitor success rates
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Review any failed executions
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check webhook delivery in HubSpot
    </Step>
</Steps>



## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Webhook not triggering**

- Verify webhook subscription is active in HubSpot
- Check the webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Ensure workflow is activated in n8n
- Test webhook delivery in HubSpot developers portal

**Contacts not matching**

- Verify contact has firstname, lastname, and company
- Check for typos or abbreviations in company names
- Some individuals may not be in Explorium's database
- Email matching improves accuracy significantly

**Updates failing in HubSpot**

- Check API token has contact write permissions
- Verify property names exist in HubSpot
- Ensure rate limits haven't been exceeded
- Check for validation rules on properties

**Missing enrichment data**

- Not all prospects have all data types
- Phone numbers may be less available than emails
- Profile enrichment is optional and may not always return data



Error HandlingBuilt-in error resilience:

- Failed matches don't block other contacts
- Each batch processes independently
- Partial enrichment is possible
- All errors are logged for review



Debugging Tips

1. **Check webhook logs**: HubSpot shows delivery attempts
2. **Review executions**: n8n logs show detailed error messages
3. **Test with pinned data**: Use the sample data for isolated testing
4. **Verify API responses**: Check Explorium API returns expected data



## Best Practices

### Data Quality

1. **Complete contact records**: Ensure name and company are populated
2. **Standardize company names**: Use official names, not abbreviations
3. **Include existing emails**: Improves match accuracy
4. **Regular data hygiene**: Clean up test and invalid contacts



### Performance Optimization

1. **Batch size**: 6 is optimal for rate limits
2. **Webhook reliability**: Monitor delivery success
3. **API quotas**: Track usage in both platforms
4. **Execution history**: Regularly clean old executions



### Compliance & Privacy

1. **GDPR compliance**: Ensure lawful basis for enrichment
2. **Data minimization**: Only enrich necessary fields
3. **Access controls**: Limit who can modify enriched data
4. **Audit trail**: Document enrichment for compliance



## Customization Options

### Additional Enrichment

Extend with more Explorium data:

- Job titles and departments
- Social media profiles
- Professional experience
- Skills and interests
- Company information



### Enhanced Processing

Add workflow logic for:

- Lead scoring based on enrichment
- Routing based on data quality
- Notifications for high-value matches
- Custom field mapping



Integration ExtensionsConnect to other systems:

- Sync enriched data to CRM
- Trigger marketing automation
- Update data warehouse
- Send notifications to Slack



## API Considerations

### HubSpot Limits

- **API calls**: Monitor daily limits
- **Webhook payload**: Max 200 contacts per trigger
- **Rate limits**: 100 requests per 10 seconds
- **Property limits**: Max 1000 custom properties



### Explorium Limits

- **Match API**: Batched for efficiency
- **Enrichment calls**: Two parallel enrichments
- **Rate limits**: Based on your plan
- **Data freshness**: Real-time matching



### Architecture Considerations

This workflow integrates with:

- HubSpot workflows and automation
- Marketing campaigns and sequences
- Sales engagement tools
- Reporting and analytics
- Other enrichment services



### Security Best Practices

- **Webhook validation**: Verify requests are from HubSpot
- **Token security**: Rotate API tokens regularly
- **Access control**: Limit workflow modifications
- **Data encryption**: All API calls use HTTPS
- **Audit logging**: Track all enrichments



## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Field Mapping

Modify the Update HubSpot node to map to custom properties:

```javascript JavaScript
// Example custom mapping
{
  "custom_mobile": "{{ $json.data.mobile_phone }}",
  "custom_linkedin": "{{ $json.data.linkedin_url }}",
  "enrichment_date": "{{ $now.toISO() }}"
}
```



### Conditional Processing

Add logic to process only certain contacts:

- Filter by contact source
- Check for specific properties
- Validate email domains
- Exclude test contacts
