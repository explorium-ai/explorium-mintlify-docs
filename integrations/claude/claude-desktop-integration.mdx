#### Example Conversations

**Finding Companies:**

```
You: Find me 10 SaaS companies in San Francisco with 50-200 employees

Claude: I'll search for SaaS companies in San Francisco with 50-200 employees.

[Searches using fetch_businesses tool]

I found 10 SaaS companies matching your criteria:

1. TechFlow Analytics
   - 125 employees
   - Revenue: $10M-$25M
   - Technologies: AWS, React, PostgreSQL

2. DataSync Solutions
   - 87 employees
   - Revenue: $5M-$10M
   - Technologies: Google Cloud, Python, MongoDB

[... continues with detailed results]
```

**Researching Contacts:**

```
You: Who is the CTO of Snowflake and what's their background?

Claude: I'll look up information about Snowflake's CTO.

[Uses match_businesses, then enrich_businesses_financial_metrics]

The CTO of Snowflake is Benoit Dageville. Here's his background:
- Co-founder of Snowflake
- Previously at Oracle for 16 years
- PhD in Computer Science from University of Paris
- Expertise in database systems and query optimization
```

## Common Patterns

### Research Assistant Pattern

Transform your AI into a business research assistant:

```
1. User asks about a company or industry
2. AI uses match_businesses or fetch_businesses
3. AI enriches with firmographics, technographics, financials
4. AI summarizes findings in natural language
```

### Sales Intelligence Pattern

Enable your AI to support sales activities:

```
1. User provides target company name
2. AI finds company with match_businesses
3. AI fetches key contacts with fetch_prospects
4. AI enriches contact information
5. AI provides actionable insights
```

### Market Analysis Pattern

Use AI for competitive intelligence:

```
1. User asks about market segment
2. AI searches companies with filters
3. AI aggregates statistics
4. AI identifies trends and patterns
5. AI generates market report
```

## Best Practices

### <Icon icon="bullseye-arrow" size={24} /> Prompt Engineering

**Be Specific**

```
Good: "Find B2B SaaS companies in NYC with 50-200 employees using AWS"
Bad: "Find some tech companies"
```

**Chain Requests**

```
"First find Microsoft's business ID, then show me all VPs in their engineering department"
```

**Request Formats**

```
"Show me the results as a table with company name, size, and revenue"
```

### <Icon icon="bolt" size={24} /> Performance Tips

- **Batch Operations**: Ask for multiple companies at once
- **Specific Filters**: Use precise criteria to reduce results
- **Caching**: AI assistants often cache recent results
- **Pagination**: Request specific page numbers for large datasets

### <Icon icon="lock" size={24} /> Security Considerations

- Store API keys in secure configuration files
- Never share API keys in conversations
- Use read-only keys when possible
- Monitor usage through the admin panel

## Advanced Features

### Tool Chaining

Most AI assistants can automatically chain multiple tools:

```
"Find the top 5 competitors of Salesforce and compare their employee counts and technologies"

This triggers:
1. match_businesses (Salesforce)
2. enrich_businesses_competitive_landscape
3. match_businesses (for each competitor)
4. enrich_businesses_firmographics
5. enrich_businesses_technographics
```

### Conversational Memory

AI assistants maintain context across messages:

```
You: "Find info about Uber"
AI: [Provides Uber details]
You: "Now show me their main competitors"
AI: [Understands "their" refers to Uber]
```

### Natural Language Filters

Convert natural language to API filters:

```
"Companies founded in the last 3 years" <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> company_age: ["0-3"]
"Mid-size businesses" <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> company_size: ["51-200", "201-500"]
"Tech companies" <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> linkedin_category: ["Technology"]
```

"Give me a complete profile of Tesla including their technology stack,
financial metrics, recent events, and key executives"
```

### Competitive Analysis

```

```

### Lead Generation

```

```

### Market Trends

are using AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure?"
```
