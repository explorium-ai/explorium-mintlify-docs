The Salesforce connector offers the following:

## Imports object's data from Salesforce to be enriched

The system enables you to pull data from Salesforce into the Enrich module using a defined query. The query will support any type of object in Salesforce, and then you can enrich these objects in the Enrich module, and create an Enriched recipe.

## Export enrichments from the Enrich module into Salesforce

Based on selected enrichments, you will be able to update the relevant Salesforce’s object. Mapping of the updated fields is done by implicit convention.

## Periodic and scheduled enrichment

Based on the pre-defined Enrich module recipe, you can define a periodic schedule run to enrich the selected Salesforce objects. The selected objects to be defined use a query, as defined in the Enrich recipe. The objects will be enriched, based on the Signal Studio recipe. The enriched fields will be updated in Salesforce.

## Connecting to Salesforce

There are three options to connect to a Salesforce connector:

- Create a new project
- Edit an existing project connection
- Export data from the Export &gt; Jobs
