## What are Data Classifications (Ontologies)?

A data classification (ontologies) is the classification of the data loaded into the Explorium system, the type of data in a column, such as a zip code, city, email, credit card number, text, numeric, categorical and so on.

Explorium automatically assigns data classifications (ontologies) when you load data into the platform, and Explorium uses the data classification (ontology) to determine which external data can be used to enrich it. From a date column, for example, we can extract the day of the month, day of the week, the month, and the year.

The data classification (ontology) is also being used to normalize the data, for example, we know how to handle state codes if classified as US state, but we won't know to handle it the same way if classified as a category.

Where a data classification (ontology) is incorrect you can select the correct data classification (Ontology) by hovering over the data classification and selecting a new data classification. For more information, click here.

## Now proceed to transform your data.

To avoid potential parsing errors make sure that your numeric data does not contain any non-numeric characters. For zip codes in US, you should only include numeric characters.

We recommend that you add a regional prefix to the phone number and make sure that “address” contains the full address of the location, including street, city, region, and zip code, and if possible, country and house number.
