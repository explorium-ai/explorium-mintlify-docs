To help track and manage usage on our platform, we measure consumption in credits.
A credit is defined as one of the following:

1. **An enriched row**
2. **A generated row**
3. **A predicted row**

Consumption can occur through downloads, API calls, or batch jobs.

## Platform Consumption Breakdown

**Enrich Module**: When you upload tabular data to the platform and enrich it with external data, each enriched row will consume one credit upon export.

**Generate Module**: Data generated based on your search criteria will consume one credit per generated row upon export.

**Predict Module**: Uploading tabular data for predictions (Using the predict step) will consume one credit for each predicted row upon export.

## Consumption operation

Consumption occurs through three primary methods:

<Note>
**Note**

Consumption is counted only after the following operations. Recipe operations on their own doesn't trigger consumption.
</Note>

**Downloads**: When you download enriched, generated, or predicted data from the platform, the consumption will be counted in credits accordingly.

**API Calls**: Consumption will also be counted in credits when you make API calls to enrich, generate, or predict data.

**Batch Jobs**: If you're running scheduled or ad-hoc batch jobs for enrichment, generation, or prediction, the consumption will be counted in credits based on the number of rows processed.
