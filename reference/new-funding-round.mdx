## Description

A **New Funding Round** event tracks when a company raises capital from investors. This information is essential for understanding business growth, market trends, and investment opportunities. Funding rounds are categorized by stages, such as seed, Series A, B, C, and beyond.

**Important:** The **New Funding Round** event retrieves only **recent funding announcements** within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months). If no funding event was announced in this timeframe, no data will be available.

**Need historical funding data?** Use the **Funding & Acquisitions Enrichment API** to access past funding rounds.

## Use cases:

- **Investor Insights**: Identify companies attracting significant investment.
- **Startup & Market Trends**: Track emerging companies and industries receiving funding.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Analyze how competitors are securing funding.
- **Valuation Tracking**: Understand how company valuations change over time.
