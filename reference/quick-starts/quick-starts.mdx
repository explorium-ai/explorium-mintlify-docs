## Recommended Workflow

To maximize efficiency and ensure precise targeting, follow this structured flow when working with Explorium’s API:

1. **Assess Market Potential** – Use the stats endpoint to gauge the size and scope of your target audience before making large-scale data fetches.
2. **Match Businesses** – Use the match endpoint to find the most accurate `business_id` for the companies you are targeting. Extract `business_id` to ensure precise data retrieval in the next steps.
3. **Fetch Business Data** – Retrieve company records that match your desired filters (e.g., industry, company size, location) using the matched `business_id`.
4. **Match Prospects** – Use the match endpoint to find the most accurate `prospect_id` for relevant employees within the selected businesses. Extract `prospect_id` to proceed with enrichment.
5. **Fetch & Enrich Prospects** – Retrieve prospects using the matched `prospect_id`, then enrich them with verified contact details such as email addresses and phone numbers for effective outreach.
6. **Refine & Iterate** – Adjust filters based on initial results to optimize for precision and efficiency.

By first matching businesses and prospects using the match endpoints, you ensure that the data retrieved is highly accurate and relevant. Extracting `business_id` and `prospect_id` at the right stages allows for better enrichment and precise targeting, minimizing redundant API calls and maximizing efficiency.

## Best Practices for Using the API

- **Optimize API Calls:** Use the `stats` endpoint before fetching full datasets to avoid unnecessary calls.
- **Refine Filters:** Use multiple filtering layers to get precise results without retrieving excessive data.
- **Paginate Large Datasets:** Break down requests into pages to manage data flow efficiently.
- **Monitor Rate Limits:** Ensure compliance with API rate limits to maintain performance and avoid throttling.
