title: "Use Case : Prospecting & Lead Enrichment"
---

## **Overview**

In this example, we’ll walk through how to identify and reach **marketing** or **sales** prospects at **small to medium-sized US software companies** using Explorium’s Partner Service API. This demonstrates an **SDR (Sales Development Representative) workflow** from start to finish:

1. **Check Market Size**: Use the `statistics` endpoint to see if the audience is large enough (and not waste time fetching too much data).
2. **Fetch Businesses**: Retrieve actual companies matching your filters, enabling a targeted approach.
3. **Fetch Prospects**: Identify relevant individuals (marketing or sales employees) working at those companies.
4. **Enrich Prospects**: Obtain direct contact details (emails, phone numbers) so you can reach out effectively.


## **Before You Begin**

### **1. Obtain Your API Key**

You’ll need a valid API key for all endpoints. For instructions on how to register and obtain credentials, see our [**Authentication Guide**](/reference/getting_your_api_key).

### **2. Understand the Filters and Parameters**

* **Filters**: `values` objects to include or exclude certain attributes (see **List of Business Filters** and **List of Prospect Filters**).
* **Pagination**: You can specify `page` and `page_size` (up to 100 records per page).

## **Scenario**

Meet **Alex**, a Sales Manager who wants to reach out to **Marketing** or **Sales** prospects at **small- to medium-sized US software companies**. Alex only has **high-level criteria** (e.g., US-based software companies with 11–50 employees). Ultimately, Alex needs **contact information** (emails, phone numbers, etc.) for relevant prospects.

Let’s see how Alex can accomplish this using our Partner Service API:

1. **Explore** the potential market with business statistics.
2. **Fetch** the actual business records that match Alex’s filters.
3. **Fetch** prospects working at those businesses, refined by job level or department.
4. **Enrich** those prospects with contact details (e.g., emails, phone numbers).

**Why fetch businesses first?**<br/>
You could fetch prospects directly using filters on `job_department` or `location`, but if you need to target specific sets of companies or validate which companies are relevant, retrieving them first gives you **better control** and **more precise targeting**.

## **1. Check Market Size via Business Statistics**

First, Alex wants a quick overview of **how many** such businesses exist to gauge if the audience is large enough:

* **Country Code**: `"us"`
* **Company Size**: `"11-50"`
* **Google Category**: `"software"`, or **LinkedIn® category**: `"software development"`, etc.

By calling the **Business Statistics** endpoint (`POST /api/v1/businesses/stats`), Alex gets an aggregated overview before committing to a full fetch.

#### **Why?**

* Avoids fetching thousands of records prematurely.
* Confirms the potential size of your target audience.

#### **Sample Request (Python)**

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python expandable
  import requests
  BASE_URL = "<https://api.explorium.ai/v1">
  API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
  headers = {
      "API_KEY": API_KEY,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  payload_stats = {
      "filters": {
          "country_code": {
              "values": ["us"]
          },
          "company_size": {
              "values": ["11-50"]
          },
          "google_category": {
              "values": ["software company"]
          }
          # Or "linkedin_category": { "type": "includes", "values": ["software development"] }
      }
  }
  response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/businesses/stats", headers=headers, json=payload_stats)
  stats_data = response.json()
  print("Stats Response:")
  print(stats_data)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### **What You Get**

Aggregated counts, distribution by category, location, revenue, etc.

#### **Example snippet:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JSON expandable
  {
    "total_results": 12000,
    "stats": {
      "business_categories_per_location": {
        "Software company": {
          "California, US": 8000,
          "New York, US": 2000,
          "Texas, US": 1000,
          "total": 11000
        },
        "other_categories": {
          ...
        }
      },
      "revenue_per_category": { ... },
      "number_of_employees_per_category": { ... }
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Armed with this summary, Alex sees about **12,000** potential businesses. That’s large but manageable with the next step.

## **2. Fetch the Actual Businesses**

Next, Alex calls the **Fetch Businesses** endpoint (`POST /api/v1/businesses`) to retrieve **actual records**. We’ll supply the same filters as above, plus some paging parameters.

* **Mode**: `full` returns all available fields, including `business_id`.

#### **Sample Request (Python)**

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python expandable
  payload_fetch = {
      "mode": "full",
      "size": 5000,      # Total number of results to fetch (up to 10,000 in this example)
      "page_size": 100,  # Up to 100 records per page
      "page": 1,         # Start with page 1
      "filters": {
          "country_code": {
              "values": ["us"]
          },
          "company_size": {
              "values": ["11-50"]
          },
          "google_category": {
              "values": ["software company"]
          }
      }
  }
  response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/businesses", headers=headers, json=payload_fetch)
  business_data = response.json()
  print("Business Fetch Response:")
  print(business_data)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### **Response Example (Python)**

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JSON expandable
  {
    "total_results": 12000,
    "page": 1,
    "total_pages": 120,
    "data": [
      {
        "business_id": "8adce3ca1cef0c986b22310e369a0793",
        "name": "Example Software Inc.",
        "domain": "examplesoftware.com",
        "country_name": "united states",
        "number_of_employees_range": "11-50",
        ...
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Alex can paginate through multiple pages if needed. Each record includes a `business_id`—important for the next step.

<Tip>
**Tip:**

* If you see `total_pages \> 1`, **paginate** by incrementing the `page` parameter.
* For more info, see [**Fetch Business Reference**](/reference/fetch_businesses).
</Tip>

## **3. Fetch Relevant Prospects for Those Businesses**

Having the `business_id` fields, Alex can now find **prospects** (contacts) at these companies. For example, if Alex wants **Marketing** or **Sales** job departments, the **Prospects** endpoint supports filters like `job_department` or `job_level`.

* **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/prospects`

* **Filters**:

  * `business_id` to specify which companies
  * `job_department` = `"marketing"`, `"sales"`, etc.
  * `has_email` = `true` if you need contacts with an email address

#### **Sample Request (Python)**

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python expandable
  # Collect the first 3 business_ids from business_data
  business_ids = [item["business_id"] for item in business_data["data"][:3]]
  payload_prospects = {
      "mode": "full",
      "size": 100,      # max total prospects
      "page_size": 50,
      "page": 1,
      "filters": {
          "business_id": {
              "type": "includes",
              "values": business_ids
          },
          "job_department": {
              "type": "includes",
              "values": ["marketing", "sales"]
          },
          "has_email": {
              "type": "exists",
              "value": True
          }
      }
  }
  response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/prospects", headers=headers, json=payload_prospects)
  prospect_data = response.json()
  print("Prospect Fetch Response:")
  print(prospect_data)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### **Response Example (Python)**

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JSON expandable
  {
    "total_results": 56,
    "data": [
      {
        "prospect_id": "xyz123456789abc",
        "full_name": "Jane Marketing",
        "job_title": "Marketing Manager",
        "company_name": "Example Software Inc.",
        "emails": [
          "[email protected]"
        ],
        ...
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now Alex has a list of **prospect IDs** and relevant fields like `job_title` or `job_department` and more, but **no** direct email or phone. That’s where **Contact Information Enrichment** comes in.

### **Why fetch, then enrich?**

* **Prospect Fetch** returns basic info like full name, job title, job department—but **does not** include direct emails or phone numbers.
* If you need contact details (emails, phone), you’ll **enrich** them in the next step.
* For more info, see [**Fetch Prospects Reference**](/reference/fetch_prospects).

## **4. Enrich Prospect with Contact Info**

By default, the **Prospect Fetch** endpoint (`POST /api/v1/prospects`) returns general prospect attributes (e.g., name, job department, job title) **without** providing direct contact details. To obtain **email addresses**, **phone numbers**, or similar fields, you need to call the **Contact Information** enrichment endpoint:

* **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/prospects/contacts_information/enrich`
* You can pass a `prospect_id` (from the fetch step) to receive the contact details.

#### **Sample Request (Python)**

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python expandable
  import requests
  BASE_URL = "https://api.explorium.ai/v1"
  API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
  headers = {
      "API_KEY": API_KEY,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  prospect_id_to_enrich = "xyz123456789abc"  # from the Prospects Fetch response
  payload_enrich_contact_info = {
      "prospect_id": prospect_id_to_enrich
  }
  response = requests.post(
      f"{BASE_URL}/prospects/contacts_information/enrich",
      headers=headers,
      json=payload_enrich_contact_info
  )
  contact_info = response.json()
  print("Contact Information Enrichment Response:")
  print(contact_info)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### **Response Example (Python)**

<CodeGroup>
  ```js JSON expandable
  {
    "response_context": {
      "correlation_id": "abcdefg1234",
      "request_status": "success"
    },
    "data": {
      "emails": [
        "[email protected]",
        "[email protected]"
      ],
      "professions_email": "[email protected]",
      "phone_numbers": "+1-555-123-4567",
      "mobile_phone": "+1-555-987-6543"
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

With this, Alex can confidently **reach out** to prospects via phone or email, completing the entire funnel from:

1. **Identifying** interesting businesses
2. **Fetching** them
3. **Finding** relevant employees (prospects)
4. **Enriching** contact data

## **Putting It All Together**

1. **Statistics**: See how big your target audience is—avoid unnecessary data fetch.
2. **Fetch Businesses**: Identify relevant companies by country, category, size, etc.
3. **Fetch Prospects**: Narrow down to specific departments or job levels within those businesses.
4. **Contact Enrichment**: Obtain the direct contact info needed for outreach.

### **Why This Flow?**

* **Broader to Specific**: Start by confirming the market size, then narrow to the exact companies, then the exact people.
* **Modular**: You can skip the business step if you’re strictly prospect-focused, but it’s often easier to align leads to target companies first.
* **Efficient**: Minimizes wasted calls, ensures you only enrich individuals who truly match your criteria.

This workflow showcases a typical “start from a broad category, narrow down to specific contacts” approach. You can further customize it:

* Add job levels (e.g., “manager,” “director”)
* Filter by region or revenue range
* And so forth!

## **Next Steps**

* **Visit Our Authentication Docs** to learn more about obtaining an API key ([Authentication Docs](/reference/getting_your_api_key)).
* **Explore All Available Filters** for **Businesses** ([Business Filters](/reference/fetch_businesses)) and **Prospects** ([Prospect Filters](/reference/fetch_prospects)).
* **Pagination**: If you have more results than can fit on one page.
* **Advanced Use Cases**: Check out other “quickstarts” for narrower or alternative workflows.

**Happy Prospecting!**
