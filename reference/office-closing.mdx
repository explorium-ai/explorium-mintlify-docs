title: "Office closing"

## Description

An **Office Closing** event tracks when a company shuts down a physical office or facility. This data provides insights into business downsizing, market exits, and shifts in operational strategy.

**Important:** The **Office Closing** event is available only for **recent office closures** that occurred within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months). If no office closure was recorded during this period, no data will be returned.

**For long-term office location history,** refer to the **Firmographic Enrichment API**.

## Use cases

- **Market Contraction Analysis**: Identify industries or regions where businesses are downsizing.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Track competitor office closures to understand their market shifts.
- **Economic Indicators**: Assess the impact of office closures on local economies and employment.
- **Operational Strategy**: Monitor company restructuring and realignment decisions.
