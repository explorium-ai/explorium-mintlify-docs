### Introduction

The **Fetch Prospects** endpoint allows users to retrieve a list of prospect records based on filtering criteria such as job level, department, or other professional attributes. This API is essential for sales intelligence, lead enrichment, and prospecting workflows.

<Icon icon="thumbtack" iconType="solid" color="red" /> **Key Benefits:**

- Identify **high-value prospects** based on job roles, seniority, and industry.
- Enhance **lead scoring and segmentation** with structured data.
- Retrieve **up-to-date professional details** to optimize outreach.
- Integrate seamlessly with existing **CRM and marketing automation** platforms.
- Consideration:
  - Not all filters have a high coverage rate. Using a filter with low data coverage may result in a smaller set of returned results.
  - Conversely, using broader filters can yield more results. For example, if filtering by a very specific attribute results in few matches, expanding the filter criteria may increase the number of retrieved records.
  - When filtering by location, note that there are two distinct filter types: company location and prospect location. For example, the `company_country_code` filter applies to the company's headquarters location, while the `country_code` filter applies to the individual prospect's location. This distinction is particularly important for global companies where prospects may be distributed across different locations than the company headquarters.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

    ### Data Fetching: Pagination, Filtering & Modes

    The API supports flexible data fetching through **pagination**, **filtering**, and optional **modes** to customize the amount and structure of the returned data.

    #### Pagination

    To efficiently retrieve large datasets, use the following parameters to paginate the results:

    | Parameter   | Type   | Description                                                                         |
    | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `size`      | Number | The total maximum number of records to return across all pages.   Must be ≤ 60,000. |
    | `page_size` | Number | Number of records to return per page.   Maximum value: 100.                         |
    | `page`      | Number | The page number to retrieve (1-based index).   Defaults to 1 if not specified.      |

    **Behavior Notes:**

    - If `size` is smaller than `page_size * page`, the last page may contain fewer records or be empty.
    - If pagination parameters are omitted, the API may return a default page size (implementation-specific).

    #### Filtering

    Filters allow you to narrow down results based on specific field values. All filters must be included in the request body under the `"filters"` key, as a JSON object.

    Each filter field accepts:

    - `value`: for a single filter value (e.g. `"value": "true"`)
    - `values`: for multiple possible matches (e.g. `"values": ["director", "manager"]`)

    **Example Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "filters": {
        "job_level": {
          "values": ["director", "manager"]
        },
        "has_email": {
          "value": "true"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Filter Matching Logic:**

    - Fields using `value` are matched exactly.
    - Fields using `values` are matched using an **OR** condition.
    - Filters are combined using an **AND** across different fields.

    #### Mode Parameter

    The optional `mode` parameter defines the level of detail in the returned data.

    | Mode   | Description                                                                                                            |
    | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `full` | Returns the complete data object for each prospect.   Use this when full detail is required for processing or display. |

    #### Best Practices

    - Always use `page_size` to control payload size for better performance.
    - Use `size` to set an upper limit and avoid unintentionally requesting large datasets.
    - Apply filters whenever possible to reduce response size and processing time.

The filter matches prospects whose title includes all the words. For more consistent results, prefer using job_level and job_department. Uses a single `value` with flexible keyword matching. Logic ensures all words appear in the target field, regardless of order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Examples of new levels: manager, president, senior manager, owner, advisor, freelancer, junior, director, c-suite, board member, senior non-managerial, non-managerial, partner, vice president, founder.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Default is `false`. Useful for retrieving a wider range of relevant roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This avoids manual errors and ensures valid input. Uses a list of `values`.

    | current_role_months         | Filter by number of months in current role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Use `gte` or `lte` to define how long the prospect has held their current position.

    | company_name                | Filter by company name.

  <Accordion title="Best Practices">
    - Use refined filters to retrieve the most relevant prospects.
    - Batch requests efficiently to optimize API performance.
    - Monitor pagination settings to avoid missing data.
    - Ensure data freshness by running regular queries to keep prospect information up-to-date.
    - Be mindful of filter coverage – some filters may return fewer results due to lower data availability, while broader filters may yield larger result sets.
    - If you are not certain about the exact job title, it’s recommended to set `related_job_titles=true` to expand and include semantically  related roles.
