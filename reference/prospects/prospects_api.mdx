The Explorium Prospect API equips developers with tools to retrieve, validate, enrich, and manage contact data. With these endpoints, you can:

- Retrieve detailed contact profiles based on various search criteria.
- Validate and update contact information to ensure data accuracy.
- Enrich contact records with additional insights such as social profiles, engagement metrics, and firmographic details.
- Segment prospects by industry, role, and other key attributes.
- Automate contact scoring to prioritize high-potential leads.


**Key Considerations: Real-Time vs. Historical Data**

- **Event APIs** are available **only for a defined timeframe (typically last 3 months)** and do not include historical records.
- **Enrichment APIs** provide **comprehensive historical data**, including long-term career trends, Contact details, and engagement history.
- Combining **event tracking with enrichment data** enables businesses to leverage both **immediate insights** and **historical context** in their sales and engagement strategies.
