## Description

The Prospect Events Enrollment endpoint enables you to monitor specific prospects for professional changes and milestones. This "subscription" approach automates tracking of individual career movements such as job changes, role changes, and work anniversaries.
When you enroll, the system will continuously monitor for new events related to your specified prospects. These events can be retrieved later or delivered via webhook, depending on your integration preferences.

### Important Considerations for Enrollments

- Multiple event types can be monitored for the same set of prospects.
- Each enrollment is uniquely identified by its enrollment_key.
- Events are collected in the background, optimizing API usage and ensuring you don't miss important updates.
