title: "Employee changed role"
---

## Description

An **Employee Changed Role** event tracks when an individual transitions into a new job or role. This data provides insights into career progressions, role changes, and leadership movement. The role change could occur at the same workplace they were previously or at a new one.

**Important:** The **Employee Job Changes** event tracks **only recent position changes** within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months). If no employee changed jobs within the specified timeframe, no data will be returned.

**For a historical view of workforce changes,** use the **Professional profile contact and workplace Enrichment API**.

## Use cases:

- **Talent Intelligence**: Identify professionals moving into leadership positions.
- **Sales & Outreach**: Target prospects who recently changed roles for timely engagement.
- **Competitive Insights**: Track how key personnel shifts affect businesses.
- **Recruitment Strategy**: Monitor role changes for hiring opportunities.
