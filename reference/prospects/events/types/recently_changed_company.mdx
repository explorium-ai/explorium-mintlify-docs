title: "Employee changed workplace"

## Description

An **Employee Changed Workplace** event tracks when an individual moves from one company to another. This data is essential for monitoring career transitions, business relationships, and professional network changes. An employee can keep their previous role or change roles when changing their place of work.

**Important:** The **Recently Changed Company** event surfaces **only recent job transitions** within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months). If no employees changed companies during this period, no data will be available.

**For a historical record of career transitions,** use the **Professional profile contact and workplace Enrichment API**.

## Use cases:

- **Sales & Lead Generation**: Engage with prospects who recently joined a new company.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Monitor employee movements between competitors.
- **Recruitment Strategy**: Identify candidates open to career transitions.
- **Market Analysis**: Track key industry shifts based on talent movement.
