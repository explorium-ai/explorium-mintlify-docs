## Description

A **Prospect Job Start Anniversary** event tracks when an individual reaches an annual milestone at their current company. This data is valuable for engagement strategies, career milestone tracking, and relationship-building opportunities.

**Important:** The **Employee's Workplace Anniversary** event highlights **only recent work anniversaries** that occurred within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months). If no such events were recorded, the response will be empty.

**For a historical view of employment duration trends,** refer to the **Professional profile contact and workplace Enrichment API**.

## Use cases:

- **Sales & Outreach**: Use work anniversaries as an engagement touchpoint.
- **Talent Retention Analysis**: Identify employees likely to consider career changes.
- **Networking & Relationship Building**: Celebrate milestones with clients and prospects.
- **Market Insights**: Track employee retention trends across industries.
