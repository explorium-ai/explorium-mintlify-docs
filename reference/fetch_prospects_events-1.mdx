### Introduction

The **Prospect Events** API provides insights into recent events related to selected prospects, including job changes, company transitions, and professional anniversaries. These insights are essential for timely engagement, personalized outreach, and tracking career movements.

- Track **real-time career movements** of prospects.
- Identify **engagement opportunities** based on job changes.
