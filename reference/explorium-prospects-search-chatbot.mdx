## Overview

This n8n workflow creates a chatbot that understands natural language requests for finding business prospects and automatically:

- Interprets your query using AI (Claude Sonnet 3.7)
- Converts it to proper Explorium API filters
- Validates the API request structure
- Fetches prospect data from Explorium
- Exports results as a downloadable CSV file

Perfect for sales teams, recruiters, and business development professionals who need to quickly find and export targeted prospect lists without learning complex API syntax.



## Key Features

## How It Works

### Workflow Architecture

1. **Chat Trigger**: Receives natural language queries from users
2. **Memory Buffer**: Maintains conversation context
3. **AI Agent**: Interprets queries and generates API parameters
4. **Validation**: Checks API structure against Explorium requirements
5. **API Call**: Fetches prospect data with pagination
6. **Data Processing**: Formats results for CSV export
7. **File Conversion**: Creates downloadable CSV file



### Processing Flow

```
User Query <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> AI Interpretation <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> Validation <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> API Call <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> CSV Export
     ↑                                  ↓
     └──── Error Correction Loop ←──────┘
```



### Validation Rules

The workflow validates:

- Filter keys are allowed by Explorium API
- Values match expected formats (e.g., valid country codes)
- Range filters have proper gte/lte values
- No duplicate values in arrays
- Required structure is maintained



## Usage Guide

### Basic Conversation Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Start with your query">
	```
	"Find me VPs of Sales at software companies in the US"
	```
</Step>
<Step title="Bot processes and responds">
	- Generates API filters
	- Validates the structure
	- Fetches data
	- Returns CSV download link
</Step>
<Step title="Refine if needed">
	```
	"Can you also include directors and filter for companies with 100+ employees?"
	```
</Step>
</Steps>


### Query Tips

- **Be specific**: Include job titles, departments, company details
- **Use standard terms**: "CTO" instead of "Chief Technology Officer"
- **Specify locations**: Use country names or standard codes
- **Include size/revenue**: Helps narrow results effectively



### Advanced Queries

Combine multiple criteria:

```
"Find engineering managers and senior engineers at B2B SaaS companies
in New York and California with 50-500 employees and revenue over $5M
who have been in their role for at least 1 year"
```



## Output Format

The CSV file includes:

- Prospect ID
- Name (first, last, full)
- Location (country, region, city)
- LinkedIn profile
- Experience summary
- Skills and interests
- Company details
- Job information
- Business ID



## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Validation failed" errors**

- Check that your query uses supported filter values
- Ensure location names are spelled correctly
- Verify company sizes/revenues match allowed ranges

**No results returned**

- Broaden your search criteria
- Check if the company exists in Explorium's database
- Verify filter combinations aren't too restrictive

**Chat not responding**

- Ensure workflow is activated
- Check all credentials are properly configured
- Verify webhook URL is accessible

**Large result sets timing out**

- Try adding more specific filters
- Limit results by location or company size
- Use the size parameter (max 10,000)



### Error Messages

The bot provides clear feedback:

- **Invalid filters**: Shows which filters aren't supported
- **Value errors**: Lists correct options for each field
- **API failures**: Explains connection or authentication issues



## Performance Optimization

### Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with basic criteria and add filters
2. **Use business IDs**: When targeting specific companies
3. **Limit by contact info**: Add `has_email: true` for actionable leads
4. **Batch by location**: Process regions separately for large searches



### API Limits

- Maximum 10,000 results per search
- Pagination handles up to 100 records per page
- Rate limits apply based on your Explorium subscription



## Customization Options

### Modify AI Behavior

Edit the **AI Agent** system message to:

- Change response format
- Add custom filters
- Adjust interpretation logic
- Include additional instructions



### Extend Functionality

Add nodes to:

- Send results via email
- Import directly to CRM
- Schedule recurring searches
- Create custom reports



### Integration Ideas

- Connect to Slack for team queries
- Add to CRM workflows
- Create lead scoring systems
- Build automated outreach campaigns



## Security Considerations

- API credentials are stored securely in n8n
- Chat sessions are isolated
- No prospect data is stored permanently
- CSV files are generated on-demand



## Support Resources

For issues with:

- **n8n platform**: Check n8n documentation
- **Explorium API**: Contact Explorium support
- **Anthropic/Claude**: Refer to Anthropic docs
- **Workflow logic**: Review node configurations
