### **Description**

The **Business Intent Topics (Bombora) — Bulk** enrichment enables you to retrieve intent topic insights for **multiple businesses in a single request**.  
It reveals which topics each company is actively researching online, offering comprehensive visibility into collective business interests and buying intent across a portfolio of accounts.

Powered by **Bombora’s weekly intent dataset**, the enrichment analyzes topic-level content consumption patterns to detect **surging interest signals** and **engagement intensity** at the company level.

For each provided company (`business_id`), the enrichment returns a **ranked list of intent topics** with a **composite score above 60**, grouped by category and timestamped by week.  
The results highlight which topics each business is researching most intensely and classify them by **intent level** (*In-Depth, Active, Early*).

This enrichment is particularly useful for:
- **Account prioritization:** Identify which companies across your target list are currently researching relevant topics.
- **Intent-driven segmentation:** Group accounts by research activity and level of engagement.
- **ABM automation:** Scale intent-based personalization to entire account lists.
- **Pipeline acceleration:** Detect surging interest signals across multiple prospects simultaneously.

**Refresh cadence:** Weekly

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
 - **Input:**  
    Provide a list of `business_id` values obtained from the **Match Businesses** API.  
    Optional parameters:  
      - **`topic_parameters`** — semicolon-separated list of `"category: topic"` filters (e.g., `technology: ios;other: vendor profiling`).  
      - **`min_score`** — optional integer **> 60**. If omitted, the default threshold is **60**.

  - **Processing:**  
    The enrichment queries Bombora’s weekly dataset to identify surging topics for each company in the list.  
    Only topics with `composite_score >= threshold` are returned, where **threshold = `min_score` (if provided and >60) or 60 (default)**.

  - **Output:**  
    Returns, for each input `business_id`, the company’s **top intent topics**, including the composite score, engagement level, and weekly timestamp.

  <Accordion title="Best Practices">
    - **`Always provide valid business_id inputs`** retrieved from the **Match Businesses** API.
    - **`Specify topic_parameters`** to focus enrichment results on relevant industries or technologies.
    - **`Use min_score`** only if you wish to raise the threshold above 60 — values ≤60 are not valid.
    - **Check for null values** — if Bombora has no data for a given domain, all topic-related fields will return null.
    - **Combine intent data** with firmographic and technographic enrichments for full go-to-market insights.
