### **Description**

The **Business Intent Topics (Bombora) — Bulk** enrichment enables you to retrieve intent topic insights for **multiple businesses in a single request**.\
It reveals which topics each company is actively researching online, offering comprehensive visibility into collective business interests and buying intent across a portfolio of accounts.

Powered by **Bombora’s weekly intent dataset**, the enrichment analyzes topic-level content consumption patterns to detect **surging interest signals** and **engagement intensity** at the company level.

For each provided company (`business_id`), the enrichment returns a **ranked list of intent topics** with a **composite score above 60**, grouped by category and timestamped by week.\
The results highlight which topics each business is researching most intensely and classify them by **intent level** (_In-Depth, Active, Early_).

This enrichment is particularly useful for:

- **Account prioritization:** Identify which companies across your target list are currently researching relevant topics.
- **Intent-driven segmentation:** Group accounts by research activity and level of engagement.
- **ABM automation:** Scale intent-based personalization to entire account lists.
- **Pipeline acceleration:** Detect surging interest signals across multiple prospects simultaneously.

**Refresh cadence:** Weekly

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    ### **Input**

    Provide a list of `business_id` values obtained from the **Match Businesses API**.

    **Optional parameters:**

    - `topic_parameters` — semicolon-separated list of "category: topic" filters (e.g., `technology: ios;other: vendor profiling`).
    - `min_score` — optional integer \> 60. If omitted, the default threshold is 60.

    > 💡 **Recommendation:**\
    > To achieve a meaningful and accurate measurement of intent, it is strongly recommended to include **at least 12 topics** that reflect the company’s genuine areas of interest.\
    > Providing too few topics — or omitting the list entirely — will return _all_ available topics for the company, which may include a wide variety of unrelated subjects and lead to misleading or noisy intent insights.

    ---

    ### **Processing**

    The enrichment process queries Bombora’s weekly dataset to identify surging topics for each company in the provided list.\
    Only topics with `composite_score >= threshold` are returned, where:

    - `threshold = min_score` (if provided and \>60)
    - otherwise `threshold = 60` (default)

    ---

    ### **Output**

    Returns, for each input business_id, the company’s top intent topics, including the composite score, engagement level, and weekly timestamp.

  <Accordion title="Best Practices">
    - **`Always provide valid business_id inputs`** retrieved from the **Match Businesses** API.
    - **`Specify topic_parameters`** to focus enrichment results on relevant industries or technologies.
    - **`Use min_score`** only if you wish to raise the threshold above 60 — values ≤60 are not valid.
    - **Check for null values** — if Bombora has no data for a given domain, all topic-related fields will return null.
    - **Combine intent data** with firmographic and technographic enrichments for full go-to-market insights.
