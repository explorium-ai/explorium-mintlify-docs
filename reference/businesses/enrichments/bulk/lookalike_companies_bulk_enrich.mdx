The **Lookalike Companies Enrichment** identifies and returns businesses that closely resemble a given company across key dimensions such as industry, size, geography, and online presence. This enrichment is powered by an external API provided by Ocean.io, which uses its own similarity engine to surface relevant company lookalikes.

Similarity scores are calculated based on a combination of structured business attributes (e.g., number of employees, revenue range, industry classification, and country), semantic similarity of company descriptions, digital footprint overlap (such as website content and web signals), and additional contextual indicators sourced from Ocean.io’s data graph.

For each input company (business_id), the enrichment returns up to 3 lookalike companies, including their firmographic attributes and a similarity score indicating the strength of the match (e.g., Medium or High).

This enrichment provides a powerful signal for identifying companies that “look like” your target ideal for use cases such as lead generation, market expansion, competitive intelligence, and segmentation strategies.

  <Accordion title="Best Practices">
    - **`Always use a validbusiness_id`** obtained via the **Match Businesses** API.
    - **Interpret similarity scores** to prioritize the strongest matches for your use case (e.g. focus on “High” similarity for precise lookalikes).
    - **Combine lookalike insights** with other enrichment signals (e.g. firmographics, technographics) for deeper segmentation.
    - **Re-run lookalike queries periodically** to capture changes in the business landscape and discover new similar companies.
