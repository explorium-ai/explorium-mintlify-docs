### **Description**

The **Business Website Traffic Enrichment** provides detailed insights into a company’s online presence by surfacing **monthly web traffic metrics** sourced from SEMrush’s a leading provider of digital analytics.

For each input company (`business_id`), the enrichment resolves the associated domain and returns a set of standardized signals such as **total visits, users, traffic sources (search, social, referral, direct, paid), device breakdown (desktop vs. mobile), bounce rate, time on site, and more**.

Data is available from **January 2017** through the **start of the previous month**, and is provided in raw form directly from SEMrush.

Raw traffic data powered by :

<Accordion title="How It Works">

  * **Input:** Provide a `business_id` obtained from the **Match Businesses** API and `month_period`
  * **Processing:** The system resolves the company’s domain and queries SEMrush’s `traffic_summary` API for the most recent monthly traffic metrics.
  * **Output:** Standardized traffic data including sessions, users, traffic source distribution, device usage, bounce rate, and engagement metrics.

<Accordion title="Best Practices">

  * **Always use a valid`business_id`** from the **Match Businesses** API.
  * **Specify`month_period`** (YYYY-MM) when you want to retrieve metrics for a specific month.
  * **Check for null values** — if SEMrush has no data for a given domain, the response will contain null fields.
  * **Use rank, visits, and users together** for benchmarking against competitors.
  * **Combine traffic metrics with firmographics** to build a richer business profile.
