### **Description**

The **Business Intent Topics (Bombora)** enrichment reveals which topics companies are actively researching online, providing deeper visibility into their current business interests and buying intent.

Powered by **Bombora’s weekly intent dataset**, it analyzes topic-level content consumption patterns to detect **surging interest and engagement signals** at the company level.

For each input company (`business_id`), the enrichment returns a **ranked list of intent topics** with a **composite score above 60**, grouped by category and timestamped by week. The results highlight which topics a company is researching most intensely and classify them by **intent level** (e.g., _In-Depth, Active, Early_).

This enrichment is particularly useful for:

- **Sales prioritization:** Identify accounts actively researching your solution space.
- **Intent-based marketing:** Personalize outreach based on buyer interest.
- **ABM activation:** Power account-based strategies with real-time buying signals.
- **Pipeline acceleration:** Engage prospects showing increased purchase readiness.

**Refresh cadence:** Weekly

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    - **Input:**\
      Provide a single `business_id` obtained from the **Match Businesses** API.\
      Optional parameters:
      - **`topics`** — semicolon-separated list of `"category: topic"` filters (e.g., `technology: ios;other: vendor profiling`).
      - **`min_score`** — optional integer **\> 60**. If omitted, the default threshold is **60**.

        \
        Use the autocomplete endpoint with field `business_intent_topics` to find intent topics
    - **Processing:**\
      The enrichment queries Bombora’s weekly dataset to identify surging topics for the specified company.\
      Only topics with `composite_score >= threshold` are returned, where **`threshold = min_score (if provided and >60) or 60 (default)`**.
    - **Output:**\
      Returns the company’s **top intent topics**, each with a composite score, engagement level, and weekly timestamp.

  <Accordion title="Best Practices">
    - **`Always provide valid business_id inputs`** retrieved from the **Match Businesses** API.
    - **`Specify topic_parameters`** to focus enrichment results on relevant industries or technologies.
    - **`Use min_score`** only if you wish to raise the threshold above 60 — values ≤60 are not valid.
    - **Check for null values** — if Bombora has no data for a given domain, all topic-related fields will return null.
    - **Combine intent data** with firmographic and technographic enrichments for full go-to-market insights.
