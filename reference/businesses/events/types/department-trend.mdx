title: "Department workforce trends"
---


## Description

A **Department trend** event tracks when a company increases or decreases staffing within a specific department. This data helps monitor employment trends, workforce restructuring, and organizational growth or downsizing.

**Important:** The **Department Trend** event tracks **only recent workforce distribution changes**. If no changes occurred within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months), no data will be returned.

**For a historical workforce analysis,** use the **Workforce Trends Enrichment API**.

## Use cases:

- **Labor Market Analysis**: Identify hiring or downsizing trends within industries.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Track workforce changes in competitor organizations.
- **Economic Indicators**: Assess how staffing changes affect regional and industry employment.
- **Business Strategy**: Understand how companies adjust their workforce for growth or cost-cutting measures.


## Data Schema

**Event Name: "increase_in_&lt;department&gt;" or "decrease_in_&lt;department&gt;" (Use these values in the event_types parameter when querying workforce change events per department. Replace &lt;department&gt; with the actual department name.)**
