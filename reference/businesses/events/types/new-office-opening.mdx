## Description

A **New Office Opening** event tracks when a company establishes a new office or facility. This data provides insights into business expansion, geographic growth, and hiring trends.

**Important:** The **New Office Opening** event is limited to **recent office expansions** within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months). If the company did not open a new office during this period, the response will be empty.

**For long-term office location insights,** refer to firmographic enrichment APIs.

## Use cases:

- **Market Expansion**: Identify companies growing their physical presence.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Monitor competitor office openings.
- **Investment Insights**: Track capital expenditure on new facilities.
- **Real Estate & Economic Trends**: Analyze business activity in different regions.
