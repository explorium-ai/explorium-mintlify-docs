title: "IPO announcement"

## Description

An **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** is the process in which a private company offers shares to the public for the first time. This event marks a significant milestone for companies as they transition from private to public ownership.

The **IPO Announcement** event provides insights into companies going public by tracking official IPO announcements. This data is valuable for investors, analysts, and financial institutions looking to monitor market movements and emerging public companies.

**Important:** The **IPO Announcement** event is available only for **recent IPOs** that occurred within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months). If no IPO was announced within this timeframe, no data will be returned.

**Looking for historical IPO data?** Use the **Funding & Acquisitions Enrichment API** to access past IPO announcements.

## Use cases:

- **Investment Analysis**: Track companies entering the public market for investment opportunities.
- **Market Trends**: Identify industries experiencing high IPO activity.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Understand which competitors are transitioning to public companies.
- **Portfolio Management**: Adjust investment strategies based on IPO trends.
