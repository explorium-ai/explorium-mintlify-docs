## Description

A **Hiring by Department** event tracks when a company is actively recruiting for roles within specific departments and locations. This data helps monitor workforce expansion, industry hiring trends, and competitive recruitment strategies.

**Important:** The **Hiring by Department** event surfaces **only recent department hiring trends** within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months). If no hiring activity occurred in the selected timeframe, the response will be empty.

**For long-term workforce insights,** use the **Workforce Trends Enrichment API**.

## Use cases:

- **Workforce Trends**: Identify industries and companies with growing hiring activity.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Track hiring patterns of competitors.
- **Economic Indicators**: Understand job market health in specific sectors.
- **Talent Acquisition**: Optimize recruitment strategies by targeting high-growth industries.
