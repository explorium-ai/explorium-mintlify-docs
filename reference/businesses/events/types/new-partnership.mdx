## Description

A **New Partnership** event tracks when two or more companies form a strategic alliance. This data provides insights into business collaborations, market expansions, and competitive strategies.

**Important:** The **New Partnership** event retrieves only **recent partnership announcements** within the last quarter (`timestamp_from` should be set to the past 3 months). If no partnership was announced in this timeframe, no data will be available.

**For historical partnership records,** use the **Competitive Landscape Enrichment API**.

## Use cases:

- **Market Expansion Analysis**: Identify industries where strategic partnerships are forming.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Track competitor alliances and collaborations.
- **Investment & Business Development**: Assess potential business opportunities through partnerships.
- **Supply Chain & Operations**: Understand key supplier-buyer relationships and ecosystem expansions.
