## Description

The **Business Events** endpoint delivers timely insights into key business activities, such as **funding rounds, IPOs, product launches, hiring trends, office openings and more**. This enables users to monitor industry shifts, analyze market dynamics, and make informed decisions based on recent developments.

Each event provides a snapshot of **real-time changes** occurring within businesses, offering valuable intelligence on company growth, strategic moves, and workforce fluctuations.

### Important Considerations for Event

- Events are **limited to recent occurrences** and are available **`only within the timeframe defined intimestamp_from`** , which should be set to **the last quarter (past 3 months)**.
- If no qualifying events took place in the specified period, the response will be empty.
- This API does not provide historical records. To access past data, refer to the appropriate **Enrichment API** endpoints.
