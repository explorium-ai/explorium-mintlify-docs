## Description

The Business Events Enrollment endpoint allows you to monitor specific businesses for future events. Rather than making repeated manual queries, enrollments let you "subscribe" to events for selected business IDs. This enables automated tracking of company activities such as funding rounds, IPOs, product launches, and more.\
When you enroll, the system will continuously monitor for new events matching your criteria. These events can be retrieved later or delivered via webhook, depending on your integration preferences.

### Important Considerations for Enrollments

- Multiple event types can be monitored for the same set of businesses.
- Each enrollment is uniquely identified by its enrollment_key and enrollment_id.
- Events are collected in the background, optimizing API usage and ensuring you don't miss important updates.

  <Accordion title="How It Works">
    - **Input**: Define parameters including business_ids, and event_types.
    - **Processing**: The system registers your enrollment and begins monitoring for events.
    - **Output**: A confirmation response containing your enrollment_id for future reference.
