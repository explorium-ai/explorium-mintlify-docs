## Description

The **Match Businesses** endpoint is the **first step** in the data enrichment process. It enables users to accurately identify businesses based on their **name or domain**, returning a **unique Business ID** that acts as the **foundation for all subsequent API interactions**.

This endpoint is designed to provide **high-accuracy business matching** by leveraging **multiple data sources, validation layers, and proprietary algorithms** to ensure precise identification.

Once a business is successfully matched, its **Business ID** becomes the **primary key** for retrieving enriched company data, accessing financial insights, monitoring real-time business events, and performing additional analytics through other Explorium APIs.

    ### How It Works

    **Input**: A list of business identifiers, which can include `name`, `website (domain)`, and `linkedin_company_url`.\
    **Processing**: The system cross-references multiple internal datasets to determine the best possible match.\
    **Output**: A structured response containing the matched Business IDs, preserving the exact order of the input list.

    ### Matching Strategy

    When using the **Business Match** endpoint, the system applies a multi-step resolution strategy based on the fields you provide — primarily `name` and `website`.

    #### 1. Primary Matching — Smart Fuzzy Logic (Name + Website)

    We begin by attempting to match the business using both the company name and website domain.\
    The company name is evaluated using a smart fuzzy matching algorithm designed to handle:

    - Common variations and abbreviations
    - Typos and noisy CRM inputs
    - Token normalization, semantic similarity, and industry-aware string processing

    The website (domain) serves as a strong anchoring signal to disambiguate between similarly named companies and to boost confidence.\
    This phase ensures high-precision matching while remaining robust to imperfect input data.

    #### 2. Fallback Matching — Website Only

    If the system fails to find a confident match using both name and domain, it automatically falls back to matching by website alone.\
    Because domains are typically unique and consistent across organizations, this fallback ensures matches can still be returned when the company name is incomplete, inconsistent, or incorrect.

    ### Important Notes

    - Fallback matching from **name + website → website only** occurs only when both fields are provided.
    - If only the website is supplied, it will be used directly for matching.
    - If only the name is provided, matching relies solely on fuzzy name resolution without domain anchoring.
    - This logic is aligned with the AgentSource model, which emphasizes main site-level resolution (not individual branches).

    ### Example Scenarios

    | Input                                               | Matching Outcome                             |
    | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
    | `Name: Starbucks EMEA`, `Website: starbucks.com`    | Match using name + website (fuzzy supported) |
    | `Name: abcxyz`, `Website: starbucks.com`            | Fallback — match using website only          |
    | `Name: Starbucks`, `Website: fakeurl.xyz`           | No match — invalid domain                    |
    | `Name: (empty)`, `Website: starbucks.com`           | Match using website only                     |
    | `Name: Starbuks Intl Ltd`, `Website: starbucks.com` | Match using fuzzy logic + website            |

    ### Recommendation

    To get the best possible results:

    - Always include both `name` and `website` when calling the Business Match endpoint.
    - This enables the system to apply smart fuzzy matching **and** fallback recovery for unmatched names — maximizing accuracy, coverage, and confidence.
