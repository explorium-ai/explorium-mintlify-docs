## Description

The **Match Businesses** endpoint is the **first step** in the data enrichment process. It enables users to accurately identify businesses based on their **name or domain**, returning a **unique Business ID** that acts as the **foundation for all subsequent API interactions**.

This endpoint is designed to provide **high-accuracy business matching** by leveraging **multiple data sources, validation layers, and proprietary algorithms** to ensure precise identification.

Once a business is successfully matched, its **Business ID** becomes the **primary key** for retrieving enriched company data, accessing financial insights, monitoring real-time business events, and performing additional analytics through other Explorium APIs.
