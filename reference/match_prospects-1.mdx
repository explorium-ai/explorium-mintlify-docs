### Introduction

The **Match Prospects** endpoint allows users to accurately match individual prospects to unique **Prospect IDs** using multiple fetchers, such as email, phone number, LinkedIn profile, or name and company combination. This ensures accurate lead identification and enhances sales and marketing workflows.

<Icon icon="thumbtack" color="red" iconType="solid"/> **Key Benefits:**

- Match and validate **lead data** across multiple fetchers.
- Enhance **B2B prospecting** by linking leads to business profiles.
- Improve **lead scoring and segmentation** with high-quality matches.
- Reduce **data duplication** and inconsistencies.

### Endpoint: `POST /v1/prospects/match`


<Accordion title="How It Works">

1. **Input:** Provide a list of prospects with at least one fetcher (e.g., email, phone number, LinkedIn URL, or name & company).
2. **Processing:** The system cross-references internal datasets and returns the best possible matches.
3. **Output:** A structured response with matched **Prospect IDs**, maintaining the same order as the input list.
