### Example Support Request:

<CodeGroup>
```json JSON expandable
{
"issue": "Received a 403 error when calling the Fetch Business Events API",
"steps_to_replicate": "Sent a request to \`/businesses/events\` with valid parameters",
"exact_request_send": "<copy the exact request payload here>",

}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Credit Usage Policy:

- If a request **returns an error** (e.g., `403 Forbidden`, `400 Bad Request`), no credits will be deducted.
- If a request **returns no results** (i.e., no relevant data is available for the given parameters), no credits will be deducted.
- Credits are consumed **only when valid, billable data is returned** from the API.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### I received a `403 Forbidden` error.

- Check if your API key is valid and has sufficient permissions.
- Ensure you have available credits for the requested operation.
- If using a protected endpoint, confirm you have the necessary access rights.

### I received a `400 Bad Request` error.

- Verify that all request parameters are formatted correctly.
- Ensure the required fields are included in the request.

### I received a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

- You have exceeded the rate limit for API calls. Implement **exponential backoff** before retrying.
- Monitor your API usage and consider upgrading your plan if needed.

### I received a `500 Internal Server Error`.

- This could indicate a temporary issue on our side. Try again later, and if the problem persists, contact support with your correlation ID.
